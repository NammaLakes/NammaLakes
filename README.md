 Introduction
NammaLakes is an IoT-based distributed lake monitoring system designed to track water quality, pollution levels, and environmental changes using real-time sensor data.

This documentation provides an overview of the architecture, implementation, and deployment of the system.

 Getting Started
1. Install Docusaurus
Run the following command to install Docusaurus:

sh
Copy
Edit
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic
Or with Yarn:

sh
Copy
Edit
yarn create docusaurus my-website classic
2. Start the Development Server
Navigate to the project directory and run:

sh
Copy
Edit
cd my-website  
npm run start
This will start a local development server at http://localhost:3000/.

 System Architecture
The NammaLakes system is built with the following components:

Frontend: React + Docusaurus
Backend: FastAPI / Node.js (Express)
Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB
IoT Devices: ESP32 / Raspberry Pi
Deployment: Docker, AWS/GCP
Features:
 Real-time data collection from multiple sensors
 Alerts & notifications for abnormal conditions
 Map integration for sensor locations
 REST API & MQTT for seamless integration
 System Design
The system consists of multiple IoT sensors deployed across lakes, communicating with a centralized backend that processes and visualizes the data.

IoT Sensors: Measure parameters like pH, turbidity, temperature.
Edge Processing: Data is filtered before transmission.
Cloud Backend: Stores and processes sensor data.
Dashboard: Interactive web UI for visualization.
 Implementation
The implementation involves:

Setting up IoT devices and configuring MQTT for communication.
Developing the backend with FastAPI/Express.js for data ingestion.
Designing the database schema in PostgreSQL/MongoDB.
Building the frontend using React + Docusaurus for visualization.
Deploying the system on AWS/GCP with Docker.
 Testing
To ensure the system runs smoothly, we perform:

Unit Testing: Verify individual components (backend & frontend).
Integration Testing: Ensure seamless data flow between devices & backend.
Performance Testing: Measure system responsiveness under heavy loads.
Security Testing: Identify vulnerabilities in data transmission.
 Deployment
The system is containerized with Docker and deployed on AWS/GCP using:

Docker Compose for managing multiple services.
CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.
Cloud databases for high availability.
Scalable API endpoints using AWS Lambda/FastAPI.
